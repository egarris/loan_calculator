# Loan Calculator

This is the 5th project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track. This guided project asked me to create a loan calculator that can calculate differentiated and annuity payments, number of periods, the loan principal and overpayment amounts. It was aimed at beginners, so I made it a little more interesting by refactoring my code into a class.

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/90?track=2):

"Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Letâ€™s make a program that can help us with that!"

This program is run from the command line. The 'type' arguement must be specified as either 'diff' or 'annuity'. At least 3 of the following 4 arguments also must be specified: principal, payment, interest rate, or periods (number of months). See the below image for an example.
